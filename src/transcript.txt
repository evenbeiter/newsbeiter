Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, August 15th, and this is your FT News Briefing. Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin meet for a summit in Alaska. Dubai faces competition as the finance hub of the Middle East, and why investors aren’t freaking out about Trump.

Katie Martin
A lot of people that I speak to in markets are saying this doesn’t make sense. Right?

Josh Gabert-Doyon
I’m Josh Gabert-Doyon, and here’s the news you need to start your day.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump are set to meet in Alaska today as part of a hotly anticipated summit. A reminder if you missed it: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not invited. There’s been a lot of back and forth setting expectations between the two presidents who will be there, though. Yesterday, Putin told his top officials that the US was making a, quote, energetic and sincere effort to end the conflict in Ukraine. For his part, Trump said he wasn’t certain the meeting would result in an immediate ceasefire.

For years now, Dubai has tried to build a financial centre in the desert that could rival New York and London. The emirate struggled during the global financial crisis, but it started to thrive during Covid. That growth has come with some growing pains though, and now Dubai faces competition in its own backyard. Chloe Cornish is our golf business correspondent, she’s based in Dubai, and she joins us now to talk about what’s going on there. Hi, Chloe.

Chloe Cornish
Hey, Josh.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
OK. Let’s start with all the growth that Dubai has been through first. How exactly does Dubai want to be seen by the world?

Chloe Cornish
This amount of growth has genuinely taken a lot of people in Dubai by surprise. And now, you’ve got a situation where the Dubai International Financial Centre, which is this offshore financial centre that’s based in Dubai, has its own rules which is very attractive to banking. It is having to build more towers, more office space to make room for all of these people who have arrived.

The infrastructure of the city is starting to feel a bit strained by all of the newcomers, so you’re seeing a lot more traffic jams around the Dubai International Financial Centre. House prices and the cost of rent has absolutely skyrocketed. And so there are questions about whether or not salaries have kept up with that kind of increase in cost of living, and whether in fact Dubai has become a bit of a victim of its own success in attracting so many people so fast.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Yeah, those do sound like reasons that might push people to look elsewhere. Doesn’t Dubai have a bit of a reputation problem as well?

Chloe Cornish
Dubai is a low tax jurisdiction and it has had to tackle an image of being a hub for sanctions busting and money laundering. It’s a very open economy. It’s sits near Iran. There’s a lot of people coming and going here. It also has a lot of these free zones, which are very un-transparent. But the concern hasn’t been so much around its international financial centre, which has generally been able to keep itself insulated from those kinds of reputational risks. But it’s been very aware that those things like financial crime could pose a problem to it, and it’s been quite alive to those issues.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Who are the main competitors that are trying to challenge Dubai for that position of global financial centre in the Gulf?

Chloe Cornish
One of the competitors for Dubai is right next door. It’s the emirate of Abu Dhabi, which has the United Arab Emirates’ greatest concentration of wealth. They’ve got about $1.7tn worth of sovereign wealth in Abu Dhabi. And that’s really irresistible to the likes of hedge funds and asset managers, who are hoping to get a piece of the action. And then the other potential major competitor to Dubai is Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, the capital of the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia has a much bigger domestic economy. It’s the region’s biggest domestic economy. So for many businesses, it feels like the right place in the Gulf to go and grow.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
What’s Dubai been doing to fight off that competition and to make itself unique and appealing?

Chloe Cornish
Dubai’s got a really big first-mover advantage. It started this process much earlier than the others, decades earlier than the others did. And so that kind of gravity that it has still has a big impact. Then it’s also tried to look at new technologies as well, like cryptocurrency. It’s one of the few places that has a full regulatory system that can govern cryptocurrency. It’s trying to be quite quick about changing regulation to make itself more attractive to folks like hedge fund managers. So it’s definitely not resting on its laurels.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Interesting. And Chloe, what do you think all this tells us about today’s geography of finance?

Chloe Cornish
I think maybe Dubai’s success at bringing a lot of international financiers here tells us that the financial geography of the world is changing a bit. If at one time your sort of western hemisphere centres like London and New York were really dominant — they’re still massive of course, and they’re still very dominant — but it seems like there’s more room, more interest in finding other locations as well that people can live and work. That’s not necessarily one of those traditional financial centres.

China has been pretty assertive about the way that it controls rare earth materials. And it seems to be cranking up the pressure. Now, Chinese authorities are telling foreign companies to stop stockpiling the materials they need for electric car batteries and other critical technology. And officials are limiting how many exports they approve.

The idea is to prevent foreign companies from building up rare earth inventory. Beijing has been known to use rare earths as leverage, including most recently, as a way to hit back against Trump’s tariffs. After Trump’s so-called “liberation day”, China’s tightening up of rare earth supplies actually led to shortages globally. So rare earths are set to be a major part of the trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing.

First, there was the tariff deadline, and then Trump firing the head of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Things that at other times might cause investors to pause or even retreat from the US markets altogether. But markets have remained remarkably calm. In fact, they’ve rallied again and again, hitting new record highs. My colleague, Katie Martin, writes our FT Markets column and is the host of the FT’s Unhedged podcast. She joins me now to talk through why investors just aren’t getting spooked. Hello, Katie.

Katie Martin
Hey, how you doing?

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Good. We don’t usually ask why something isn’t happening, but in this case, I wonder if you could run through some recent events that didn’t elicit any response from investors, the ones that you were surprised by.

Katie Martin
Yeah. It’s the number one rule of writing about things is that you don’t write about things that are not happening, but it is really quite weird. So you look at the news flow in terms of stuff that you would imagine would be really important for markets. Like as you mentioned, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics because he didn’t like, guess what, the labour statistics. And he’s put a loyalist in her place. He’s also appointed somebody into a role at the Federal Reserve who’s got some quite out there ideas about ways to completely reform the Fed. These are quite grim developments and the markets are like, “Well, well, nevertheless, earnings are looking pretty good in the tech sector, so let’s just carry on.” And a lot of people that I speak to in markets are saying this doesn’t make sense. Right?

Josh Gabert-Doyon
Katie, is this just a case of the glass being half full rather than half empty? I mean, are there things that investors are clinging to that would explain why the markets have rallied instead?

Katie Martin
Well, yeah, the main thing is that corporate America, particularly in the tech sector, is still doing fine actually. And so if you want to look at the world through rosier glasses, you can definitely do that. And in fact, you can do that because of some bad spots in the economic data weirdly. So for example, Trump got rid of the previous head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics because jobs data has been softening and we’ve seen through CPI, inflation numbers that came out earlier this week that inflation is stuttering a bit. We are not seeing a massive rise in prices on the back of tariffs coming into force, which is what a lot of people thought would happen. So, if you have slightly tame inflation, and if you have a jobs market that’s looking a tiny bit wobbly, then that is a recipe for cutting interest rates over the coming months potentially. That’s actually not a bad recipe for continuing to buy US stocks.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
But there were some hopes early on, right, that the market would keep Trump in check. Why hasn’t that happened?

Katie Martin
Part of the issue there is that over the course of this year, Trump has rolled back some of his more radical policies. We’re all pretty familiar with the Taco trade, right? Trump always chickens out. Market participants think every time you get a really spicy policy announcement, people look around and think, “Nah, he’s gonna chicken out of this one. He’s gonna pull back.” My point is that he’s not chickening out quite as often as he used to since that big rollback after the “liberation day” tariffs on April 2nd. He doesn’t always chicken out, but the market is trading as if he does.

Josh Gabert-Doyon
OK. If the market isn’t reacting badly to these big destabilising events, isn’t that kind of good?

Katie Martin
OK. You can see it like that. You can see it as good and you can actually on a positive note, you can really see it as a sign of resilience in US and global markets. But a couple of things. First of all, the longer that markets remain benign while Trump keeps cranking up the pressure on key institutions, the further he will think he can push it. So the reason that he backed away after the April 2nd tariff announcements is because markets really fell out of bed. The other is that if you mess about with core US economic statistics, lead investors to think that they are biased or politicised and lead investors not to trust them as much as they previously did. And if further down the road we get to the point where interest rates are not set according to the parameters that we’ve all become used to over the past 30 years or so, then we’ve got a situation in which you can have a lot of volatility, a real lack of trust and some fairly ugly moves in markets.
